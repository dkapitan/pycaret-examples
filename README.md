## Install

Although I prefer to use poetry as a package manager, pycaret doesn't support poetry yet. Hence the following workaround.

- Clone this repository
- Initialize the poetry project, make sure to use Python 3.10
- Run `poetry shell` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the .venv
